UPSTREAM: <carry>: Fix shellcheck failures for copied openshift-hack bash

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Enable build, test and verify

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Copy README content from origin

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Copy watch-termination command from openshift/origin

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Switch image and rpm build to golang 1.14

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Copy test annotation from origin

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Build openshift-compatible kube e2e binary

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Updating openshift-hack/images/hyperkube/Dockerfile.rhel baseimages to mach ocp-build-data config

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Stop annotating origin tests with [Suite:openshift]

The detection logic was error-prone (different results based on the
repo existing in GOPATH vs not) and whether a test comes from origin
can be inferred from the absence of the `[Suite:k8s]` tag.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Update hyperkube version

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Update OpenShift docs

UPSTREAM: <carry>: watch-termination: fix deletion race and write non-graceful message also to termination.log

UPSTREAM: <carry>: watch-termination: avoid false positives of NonGracefulTermination events

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) remove servicecatalog e2e that was dropped upstream

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Fix annotation rules

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Fix image refs

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Updating openshift-enterprise-hyperkube builder & base images to be consistent with ART
Reconciling with https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/b0ab44b419faae6b18e639e780a1fa50a1df8521/images/openshift-enterprise-hyperkube.yml

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Retry upstream flakes

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Update test exclussions for 1.20.0

UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash) Add detail to rebase doc

- Add new section 'Maintaining this document'
- Move checklist above the instructions to emphasize their importance
- Add new section 'Reacting to new commits'
- Mention that generated changes in carries should be dropped

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Enable CSI snapshot e2e tests

All images were uploaded to our quay.io mirror and the tests should
succeed.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Stop skipping multi-az test (skipped upstream)

UPSTREAM: <carry>: bump tag version & update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc & image

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Add Dockerfile to build pause image

Ensuring the target directory exists before writing a file to it.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: disable part of hack/verify-typecheck-providerless.sh due to our carry patches

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Updating openshift-enterprise-pod images to be consistent with ART
Reconciling with https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/691e628254f318ce56efda5edc7448ec743c37b8/images/openshift-enterprise-pod.yml

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Updating openshift-enterprise-hyperkube images to be consistent with ART
Reconciling with https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/691e628254f318ce56efda5edc7448ec743c37b8/images/openshift-enterprise-hyperkube.yml

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Add process overlap detection event to watch-termination

NOTE: Squash this to watch-termination commit on rebase.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: openshift-hack/images/os/Dockerfile: Add io.openshift.build.versions, etc.

For example, consider the current 4.10 RHCOS:

  $ oc image info -o json registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/4.10:machine-os-content
  io.k8s.description: The Universal Base Image is designed and engineered to be the base layer for all of your containerized applications, middleware and utilities. This base image is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat and updated regularly.
  io.k8s.display-name: Red Hat Universal Base Image 8
  io.openshift.build.version-display-names: machine-os=Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS
  io.openshift.build.versions: machine-os=49.84.202109102026-0
  io.openshift.expose-services:
  io.openshift.tags: base rhel8

A bunch of those seem to be inherited from the UBI base image, so we
can leave them alone.  But the io.openshift.build.* entries are
RHCOS-specific, and are consumed by 'oc adm release new ...' [1,2] and
friends to answer questions like "which RHCOS is in this release?":

  $ oc adm release info -o json quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.8.12-x86_64
  {
    "kubernetes": {
      "Version": "1.21.1",
      "DisplayName": ""
    },
    "machine-os": {
      "Version": "48.84.202109100857-0",
      "DisplayName": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS"
    }
  }

Setting this label will avoid failures when consumers like
driver-toolkit's version consumer [3]:

  name: 0.0.1-snapshot-machine-os

bump into ci-tools-built machine-os-content images that lack the
io.openshift.build.versions declaration of machine-os version [4]:

  error: unable to create a release: unknown version reference "machine-os"

I've gone with generic testing values, so hopefully this is not
something that local maintainers need to remember to bump for each
OpenShift z stream.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: rebase script

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Fix networking-related test exclusions

Tests that fail on openshift-sdn specifically should be tagged as
such, so that they don't also get skipped when running under
ovn-kubernetes or third-party network plugins.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Skip "subPath should be able to unmount" NFS test

Due to a kernel bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1854379
in Linux 5.7+ this test fails - the bind-mounted NFS share cannot be
cleanly unmounted, gets "Stale file handle" error instead on umount.
As a result this test is permafailing on Fedora CoreOS nodes.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Skip GlusterFS tests

GlusterFS is not supported in 4.x, we've been running its tests just
because we could. Now it does not work on IPv6 systems.

E [MSGID: 101075] [common-utils.c:312:gf_resolve_ip6] 0-resolver: getaddrinfo failed (Address family for hostname not supported)

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Skip GlusterFS tests

The previous commit left two GlusterFS test still running:

[sig-storage] Volumes GlusterFS should be mountable [Skipped:ibmcloud] [Suite:openshift/conformance/parallel] [Suite:k8s]
[sig-storage] Dynamic Provisioning GlusterDynamicProvisioner should create and delete persistent volumes

Skip it, we don't support Gluster and it does not work on ipv6

UPSTREAM: <carry>: 1.22 alpha & other tests disablement

UPSTREAM: <carry>: 1.21 alpha & other tests disablement

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Enable GenerciEphemeralVolume tests

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Re-enable [Feature:NetworkPolicy] tests which were wrongly disabled in rebase

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Reenable NetworkPolicy test

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Conformance tests (sysctls) should be run

We have to run this test for conformance, and the tests pass. Reenable
this block which has been disabled for 2 releases (but appears to work fine).

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Don't force-disable IPv6, dual-stack, and SCTP tests

Instead, openshift-tests will enable or disable them depending on
cluster configuration.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update Multi-AZ Cluster Volumes test name

This test was renamed upstream in
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/006dc7477f15e42ae70adc02421a5bacd068ba05

UPSTREAM: <carry>: re-enable networking tests after rebase

During a bump to k8 ver. 1.22.0, networking
tests were disabled to accomplish the bump.
This disabled netpol and older network tests.
Netpol tests will be enabled in a following
PR and therefore only partially fixes BZ.

This commit partially fixes bug 1986307.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986307

UPSTREAM: <drop>: update test annotate rules

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Add DOWNSTREAM_OWNERS

UPSTREAM: <carry>: clarify downstream approver rules

UPSTREAM: <carry>: copy extensions into resulting image

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Fix conformance and serial tests by stopping node cordoning

Master nodes already have `master` taint which
cannot be tolerated by normal workloads. If we manually
cordon the master nodes again, some of the control plane
components cannot get rescheduled unless they have
toleration to the `node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable`
taint. Even if we have the toleration in the pod
spec, because of the backwards compability issues
scheduler will ignore nodes which have `unschedulable`
field set. IOW:

- Cordoning master nodes is redundant as masters already
  have taints
- Cordoning master nodes can cause issues which are hard
  to debug as control-plane components may be evicted/preempted
  during e2e run(highly unlikely but a possibility).

So, let's stop cordoning master nodes.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: enable internal traffic policy tests

Fixes:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986307

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: enable e2e test after 1.23 rebase in sdn

Enable "[sig-network] Conntrack should be able to preserve UDP traffic when initial unready endpoints get ready" after 1.23 rebase in openshift/sdn

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Unskip OCP SDN related tests

Unskip networkPolicy tests concerning IpBlock and
egress rules since both features have now been
implemented.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: enable should drop INVALID conntrack entries test

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update e2es

UPSTREAM: revert: <carry>: Unskip OCP SDN related tests

These newly-enabled tests are breaking some CI, possibly due to race
conditions in the tests. Re-disable them for now.

This reverts commit aba8d2093ce5153bf7b5d98979a019247cf71073.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update hyperkube and image version

UPSTREAM: <drop>: disable e2e tests

- disable 'ProxyTerminatingEndpoints' feature e2e tests

- disable [sig-network] [Feature:Topology Hints] should distribute endpoints evenly
see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079958 for more context

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Add kubensenter to the openshift RPM

This carry-patch adds the kubensenter script to the openshift-hyperkube
RPM, by importing it via the new hack/update-kubensenter.sh script.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Skip session affinity timeout tests

in 4.12 and higher the default CNI is OVNKubernetes and
these two tests do not pass. Skip them. They are also
skipping in the origin test suites for ovnk.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Update kubensenter to use exec instead of direct call

Because kubelet relies on systemd's Type=notify mechanism, we don't need
or want kubensenter to keep itself in the process tree. exec is best.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update to ginkgo v2 - squash to tooling

UPSTREAM: <carry>: update rebase doc

UPSTREAM: <carry>: allow annotating with a specific suite

If a test specifies a suite, don't append another one to it. We want the
ability to add tests to a particular suite without automatically being
added to parallel conformance.

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Ensure balanced brackets in annotated test names

We recently started marking tests with apigroups, and in one case we
missed the closing bracket on the annotation resulting in the test being
erroneously skipped.

This adds a check in the annotation generation, and errors when brackets
are unbalanced.

```
Example:
$ ./hack/verify-generated.sh
FAILURE after 12.870s: hack/verify-generated.sh:13: executing '/home/stbenjam/go/src/github.com/openshift/origin/hack/update-generated.sh' expecting success: the command returned the wrong error code

```

UPSTREAM: <carry>: add CSI migration feature gates for vSphere and Azure File

This commit is the next natural step for commits 2d9a8f90b24
and d37e84c5426. It introduces custom feature gates to enable
the CSI migration in vSphere and Azure File plugins.

See openshift/enhancements#549 for details.

Stop <carrying> the patch when CSI migration becomes GA (i.e.
features.CSIMigrationAzureFile / features.CSIMigrationVSphere
are GA).

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Skip in-tree topology tests win Azure Disk migrated to CSI

Skip test that depend on in-tree Azure Disk volume plugin that (wrongly)
uses failure domains for value of "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" label in
Azure regions that don't have availability zones.

Our e2e tests blindly use that label and expect that a volume provisioned
in such a "zone" can be used only by nodes in that "zone" (= topology
domain). This is false, Azure Disk CSI driver can use such a volume in any
zone and therefore the test may randomly fail.

See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2066865

UPSTREAM: <carry>: Stop ignoring generated openapi definitions

openshift/origin needs to be able to vendor these definitions so they
need to be committed.

+# OpenShift's fork of k8s.io/kubernetes
+
+This respository contains core Kubernetes components with OpenShift-specific patches.
+
+## Cherry-picking an upstream commit into openshift/kubernetes: Why, how, and when.
+
+`openshift/kubernetes` carries patches on top of each rebase in one of two ways:
+
+1. *periodic rebases* against an upstream Kubernetes tag.  Eventually,
+any code you have in upstream Kubernetes will land in Openshift via
+this mechanism.
+
+2. Cherry-picked patches for important *bug fixes*.  We really try to
+limit feature back-porting entirely. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, your backport should at least be merged in kubernetes master branch. With every carry patch (not included in upstream) you are introducing a maintenance burden for the team managing rebases.
+
+### For Openshift newcomers: Pick my Kubernetes fix into Openshift vs. wait for the next rebase?
+
+Assuming you read the bullets above... If your patch is really far behind, for
+example, if there have been 5 commits modifying the directory you care about,
+cherry picking will be increasingly difficult and you should consider waiting
+for the next rebase, which will likely include the commit you care about or at
+least decrease the amount of cherry picks you need to do to merge.
+
+To really know the answer, you need to know *how many commits behind you are in
+a particular directory*, often.
+
+To do this, just use git log, like so (using pkg/scheduler/ as an example).
+
+```
+MYDIR=pkg/scheduler/algorithm git log --oneline --
+  ${MYDIR} | grep UPSTREAM | cut -d' ' -f 4-10 | head -1
+```
+
+The commit message printed above will tell you:
+
+- what the LAST commit in Kubernetes was (which effected
+"/pkg/scheduler/algorithm")
+- directory, which will give you an intuition about how "hot" the code you are
+cherry picking is.  If it has changed a lot, recently, then that means you
+probably will want to wait for a rebase to land.
+
+### Cherry-picking an upstream change
+
+Since `openshift/kubernetes` closely resembles `k8s.io/kubernetes`,
+cherry-picking largely involves proposing upstream commits in a PR to our
+downstream fork. Other than the usual potential for merge conflicts, the
+commit messages for all commits proposed to `openshift/kubernetes` must
+reflect the following:
+
+- `UPSTREAM: <UPSTREAM PR ID>:` The prefix for upstream commits to ensure
+  correct handling during a future rebase. The person performing the rebase
+  will know to omit a commit with this prefix if the referenced PR is already
+  present in the new base history.
+- `UPSTREAM: <drop>:` The prefix for downstream commits of code that is
+  generated (i.e. via `make update`) or that should not be retained by the
+  next rebase.
+- `UPSTREAM: <carry>:` The prefix for downstream commits that maintain
+  downstream-specific behavior (i.e. to ensure an upstream change is
+  compatible with OpenShift). Commits with this are usually retained across
+  rebases.
+
+## Updating openshift/kubernetes to a new upstream release
+
+Instructions for rebasing `openshift/kubernetes` are maintained in a [separate
+document](REBASE.openshift.md).
+
+## RPM Packaging
+
+A specfile is included in this repo which can be used to produce RPMs
+including the openshift binary. While the specfile will be kept up to
+date with build requirements the version is not updated. Building the
+rpm with the `openshift-hack/build-rpms.sh` helper script will ensure
+that the version is set correctly.

+# Maintaining openshift/kubernetes
+
+OpenShift is based on upstream Kubernetes. With every release of Kubernetes that is
+intended to be shipped as OCP, it is necessary to incorporate the upstream changes
+while ensuring that our downstream customizations are maintained.
+
+## Rebasing for releases < 4.6
+
+The instructions in this document apply to OpenShift releases 4.6 and
+above. For previous releases, please see the [rebase
+enhancement](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/rebase.md).
+
+## Maintaining this document
+
+An openshift/kubernetes rebase is a complex process involving many manual and
+potentially error-prone steps. If, while performing a rebase, you find areas where
+the documented procedure is unclear or missing detail, please update this document
+and include the change in the rebase PR. This will ensure that the instructions are
+as comprehensive and accurate as possible for the person performing the next
+rebase.
+
+## Rebase Checklists
+
+The checklists provided below highlight the key responsibilities of
+someone performing an openshift/kubernetes rebase.
+
+In preparation for submitting a PR to the [openshift fork of
+kubernetes](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes), the following
+should be true:
+
+- [ ] The new rebase branch has been created from the upstream tag
+- [ ] The new rebase branch includes relevant carries from target branch
+- [ ] Dependencies have been updated
+- [ ] Hyperkube dockerfile version has been updated
+- [ ] `make update` has been invoked and the results committed
+- [ ] `make` executes without error
+- [ ] `make verify` executes without error
+- [ ] `make test` executes without error
+- [ ] The upstream tag is pushed to `openshift/kubernetes` to ensure that
+      build artifacts are versioned correctly
+      - Upstream tooling uses the value of the most recent tag (e.g. `v1.25.0`)
+        in the branch history as the version of the binaries it builds.
+      - Pushing the tag is easy as
+```
+git push git@github.com:openshift/kubernetes.git refs/tags/v1.25.0
+```
+
+Details to include in the description of the PR:
+
+- [ ] A link to the rebase spreadsheet for the benefit for reviewers
+
+After the rebase PR has merged to `openshift/kubernetes`, vendor the changes
+into `openshift/origin` to ensure that the openshift-tests binary reflects
+the upstream test changes introduced by the rebase:
+
+- [ ] Find the SHA of the merge commit after your PR lands in `openshift/kubernetes`
+- [ ] Run `hack/update-kube-vendor.sh <o/k SHA>` in a clone of the `origin`
+      repo and commit the results
+- [ ] Run `make update` and commit the results
+- [ ] Submit as a PR to `origin`
+
+As a final step, send an email to the aos-devel mailing list announcing the
+rebase. Make sure to include:
+
+- [ ] The new version of upstream Kubernetes that OpenShift is now based on
+- [ ] Link(s) to upstream changelog(s) detailing what has changed since the last rebase landed
+- [ ] A reminder to component maintainers to bump their dependencies
+- [ ] Relevant details of the challenges involved in landing the rebase that
+      could benefit from a wider audience.
+
+## Getting started
+
+Before incorporating upstream changes you may want to:
+
+- Read this document
+- Get familiar with tig (text-mode interface for git)
+- Find the best tool for resolving merge conflicts
+- Use diff3 conflict resolution strategy
+   (https://blog.nilbus.com/take-the-pain-out-of-git-conflict-resolution-use-diff3/)
+- Teach Git to remember how you’ve resolved a conflict so that the next time it can
+  resolve it automatically (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rerere)
+
+## Send email announcing you're starting work
+
+To better spread the information send the following email:
+
+```
+Title: k8s <version> bump is starting...
+
+I'm starting the process of updating our fork to bring in
+the latest available version of kubernetes. This means that
+every PR landing in openshift/kubernetes should go through
+extra scrutiny and only 2 exceptions allow merging PRs in the
+upcoming time:
+1. High priority backports which require landing master first
+to start the backport process.
+2. Critical PRs unblocking the org.
+In both cases make sure to reach out to me for final approval.
+
+There is no ETA yet, but feel free to reach out to me with
+any questions.
+```
+
+## Preparing the local repo clone
+
+Clone from a personal fork of kubernetes via a pushable (ssh) url:
+
+```
+git clone git@github.com:<user id>/kubernetes
+```
+
+Add a remote for upstream and fetch its branches:
+
+```
+git remote add --fetch upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
+```
+
+Add a remote for the openshift fork and fetch its branches:
+
+```
+git remote add --fetch openshift https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes
+```
+
+## Creating a new local branch for the new rebase
+
+- Branch the target `k8s.io/kubernetes` release tag (e.g. `v1.25.0`) to a new
+  local branch
+
+```
+git checkout -b rebase-1.25.0 v1.25.0
+```
+
+- Merge `openshift(master)` branch into the `rebase-1.25.0` branch with merge
+  strategy `ours`. It discards all changes from the other branch (`openshift/master`)
+  and create a merge commit. This leaves the content of your branch unchanged,
+  and when you next merge with the other branch, Git will only consider changes made
+  from this point forward.  (Do not confuse this with `ours` conflict resolution
+  strategy for `recursive` merge strategy, `-X` option.)
+
+```
+git merge -s ours openshift/master
+```
+
+## Creating a spreadsheet of carry commits from the previous release
+
+Given the upstream tag (e.g. `v1.24.2`) of the most recent rebase and the name
+of the branch that is targeted for rebase (e.g. `openshift/master`), generate a tsv file
+containing the set of carry commits that need to be considered for picking:
+
+```
+echo 'Comment Sha\tAction\tClean\tSummary\tCommit link\tPR link' > ~/Documents/v1.24.2.tsv
+```
+```
+git log $( git merge-base openshift/master v1.24.2 )..openshift/master --ancestry-path --reverse --no-merges --pretty='tformat:%x09%h%x09%x09%x09%s%x09https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/commit/%h?w=1' | grep -E $'\t''UPSTREAM: .*'$'\t' | sed -E 's~UPSTREAM: ([0-9]+)(:.*)~UPSTREAM: \1\2\thttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/\1~' >> ~/Documents/v1.24.2.tsv
+```
+
+This tsv file can be imported into a google sheets spreadsheet to track the
+progress of picking commits to the new rebase branch. The spreadsheet can also
+be a way of communicating with rebase reviewers. For an example of this
+communication, please see the [the spreadsheet used for the 1.24
+rebase](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10KYptJkDB1z8_RYCQVBYDjdTlRfyoXILMa0Fg8tnNlY/edit).
+
+## Picking commits from the previous rebase branch to the new branch
+
+Go through the spreadsheet and for every commit set one of the appropriate actions:
+ - `p`, to pick the commit
+ - `s`, to squash it (add a comment with the sha of the target)
+ - `d`, to drop the commit (if it is not obvious, comment why)
+
+Set up conditional formatting in the google sheet to color these lines appropriately.
+
+Commits carried on rebase branches have commit messages prefixed as follows:
+
+- `UPSTREAM: <carry>:`
+  - A persistent carry that should probably be picked for the subsequent rebase branch.
+  - In general, these commits are used to modify behavior for consistency or
+    compatibility with openshift.
+- `UPSTREAM: <drop>:`
+  - A carry that should probably not be picked for the subsequent rebase branch.
+  - In general, these commits are used to maintain the codebase in ways that are
+    branch-specific, like the update of generated files or dependencies.
+- `UPSTREAM: 77870:`
+  - The number identifies a PR in upstream kubernetes
+    (i.e. `https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/<pr id>`)
+  - A commit with this message should only be picked into the subsequent rebase branch
+    if the commits of the referenced PR are not included in the upstream branch.
+  - To check if a given commit is included in the upstream branch, open the referenced
+    upstream PR and check any of its commits for the release tag (e.g. `v.1.25.0`)
+    targeted by the new rebase branch. For example:
+    - <img src="openshift-hack/commit-tag.png">
+
+With these guidelines in mind, pick the appropriate commits from the previous rebase
+branch into the new rebase branch. Create a new filter view in the spreadsheet to allow
+you get a view where `Action==p || Action==s` and copy paste the shas to `git cherry-pick`
+command. Use `tr '\n' ' ' <<< "<line_separated_commits>"` to get a space separated list
+from the copy&paste.
+
+Where it makes sense to do so, squash carried changes that are tightly coupled to
+simplify future rebases. If the commit message of a carry does not conform to
+expectations, feel free to revise and note the change in the spreadsheet row for the
+commit.
+
+If you first pick all the pick+squash commits first and push them for review it is easier for you
+and your reviewers to check the code changes and you squash it at the end.
+
+When filling in Clean column in the spreadsheet make sure to use the following
+number to express the complexity of the pick:
+- 0 - clean
+- 1 - format fixups
+- 2 - code fixups
+- 3 - logic changes
+
+Explicit commit rules:
+- Anything touching `openshift-hack/`, openshift specific READMEs or similar files
+  should be squashed to 1 commit named "UPSTREAM: <carry>: Add OpenShift specific files"
+- Updating generated files coming from kubernetes should be `<drop>` commit
+- Generated changes should never be mixed with non-generated changes. If a carry is
+  ever seen to contain generated changes, those changes should be dropped.
+
+## Update the hyperkube image version to the release tag
+
+The [hyperkube image](openshift-hack/images/hyperkube/Dockerfile.rhel)
+hard-codes the Kubernetes version in an image label. It's necessary to manually
+set this label to the new release tag. Prefix the commit summary with
+`UPSTREAM: <carry>: (squash)` and squash it before merging the rebase PR.
+
+This value, among other things, is used by ART to inject appropriate version of
+kubernetes during build process, so it always has to reflect correct level of
+kubernetes.
+
+## Update base-os and test images
+
+To be able to use the latest kubelet from a pull request, in this repository
+we build [machine-os-content image](openshift-hack/images/os/Dockerfile).
+Make sure that both `FROM` and `curl` operation in `RUN` command use appropriate
+OCP version which corresponds with what we have in the [hyperkube image](openshift-hack/images/hyperkube/Dockerfile.rhel).
+
+Similarly, update `FROM` in [test image](openshift-hack/images/tests/Dockerfile.rhel)
+to match the one from [hyperkube image](openshift-hack/images/hyperkube/Dockerfile.rhel).
+
+## Updating dependencies
+
+Once the commits are all picked from the previous rebase branch, and your PR
+is mostly ready, each of the following repositories need to be updated to depend
+on the upstream tag targeted by the rebase:
+
+- https://github.com/openshift/api
+- https://github.com/openshift/apiserver-library-go
+- https://github.com/openshift/client-go
+- https://github.com/openshift/library-go
+
+Often these repositories are updated in parallel by other team members, so make
+sure to ask around before starting the work of bumping their dependencies.
+
+Once the above repos have been updated to depend on the target release,
+it will be necessary to update `go.mod` to point to the appropriate revision
+of these repos by running `hack/pin-dependency.sh` for each of them and then running
+`hack/update-vendor.sh` (as per the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/vendor.md#adding-or-updating-a-dependency)).
+
+Make sure to commit the result of a vendoring update with `UPSTREAM: <drop>: bump(*)`.
+If you have already bumped the dependencies to get the repo to compile,
+don't forget to squash the commits before merging the PR.
+
+### Updating dependencies for pending bumps
+
+The upstream `hack/pin-dependency.sh` script only supports setting dependency
+for the original repository. To pin to a fork branch that has not yet been
+merged (i.e. to test a rebase ahead of shared library bumps having merged), the
+following `go mod` invocations are suggested:
+
+```
+go mod edit -replace github.com/openshift/<lib>=github.com/<username>/<lib>@SHA
+go mod tidy && go mod vendor
+```
+
+Alternatively, you can edit `go.mod` file manually with your favourite editor and use search&replace.
+
+## Review test annotation rules
+
+The names of upstream e2e tests are annotated according to the a set of
+[declarative rules](openshift-hack/e2e/annotate/rules.go). These annotations
+are used to group tests into suites and to skip tests that are known not to be
+incompatible with some or all configurations of OpenShift.
+
+When performing a rebase, it is important to review the rules to
+ensure they are still relevant:
+
+- [ ] Ensure that `[Disabled:Alpha]` rules are appropriate for the current kube
+      level. Alpha features that are not enabled by default should be targeted
+      by this annotation to ensure that tests of those features are skipped.
+- [ ] Add new skips (along with a bz to track resolution) where e2e tests fail
+      consistently.
+
+Test failures representing major issues affecting cluster capability will
+generally need to be addressed before merge of the rebase PR, but minor issues
+(e.g. tests that fail to execute correctly but don't appear to reflect a
+regression in behavior) can often be skipped and addressed post-merge.
+
+## Updating generated files
+
+- Update generated files by running `make update`
+  - This step depends on etcd being installed in the path, which can be
+    accomplished by running `hack/install-etcd.sh`.
+  - Alternatively, run it in the same container as CI is using for build_root that already has
+    the etcd at correct version
+```
+podman run -it --rm -v $( pwd ):/go/k8s.io/kubernetes:Z --workdir=/go/k8s.io/kubernetes registry.ci.openshift.org/openshift/release:rhel-8-release-golang-1.19-openshift-4.12 make update OS_RUN_WITHOUT_DOCKER=yes FORCE_HOST_GO=1
+```
+- Commit the resulting changes as `UPSTREAM: <drop>: make update`.
+
+## Building and testing
+
+- Build the code with `make`
+- Test the code with `make test`
+  - Where test failures are encountered and can't be trivially resolved, the
+    spreadsheet can be used to track those failures to their resolution. The
+    example spreadsheet should have a sheet that demonstrates this tracking.
+  - Where a test failure proves challenging to fix without specialized knowledge,
+    make sure to coordinate with the team(s) responsible for area(s) of focus
+    exhibiting test failure. If in doubt, ask for help!
+- Verify the code with `make verify`
+
+## Reacting to new commits
+
+Inevitably, a rebase will take long enough that new commits will end up being
+merged to the targeted openshift/kubernetes branch after the rebase is
+underway. The following strategy is suggested to minimize the cost of incorporating
+these new commits:
+
+- rename existing rebase branch (e.g. 1.25.0-beta.2 -> 1.25.0-beta.2-old)
+- create new rebase branch from HEAD of master
+- merge the target upstream tag (e.g. 1.25.0-beta.2) with strategy ours
+- pick all carries from renamed rebase branch (e.g. 1.25.0-beta.2-old)
+- pick new carries from the openshift/kubernetes target branch
+- add details of the new carries to the spreadsheet
+- update generated files
+
+With good tooling, the cost of this procedure should be ~10 minutes at
+most. Re-picking carries should not result in conflicts since the base of the
+rebase branch will be the same as before. The only potential sources of conflict
+will be the newly added commits.
+
+## Ensuring the stability of the release
+
+To ensure we don't regress the product by introducing a new level of kubernetes
+it is required to create a new sheet in the following spreadsheet and pass all
+the variants: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PBk3eqYaPbvY982k_a0W7EGx7CBCHTmKrN6FyNSTDeA/edit#gid=0
+
+NOTE: Double check with TRT team if the current variants in that spreadsheet
+are up-to-date.
+
+## Send email announcing upcoming merge
+
+Second email should be send close O(~3 days) to merging the bump:
+
+```
+Title: k8s <version> bump landing...
+
+<URL to your o/k PR> is bumping k8s to version <version>.
+The following repositories have been already bumped as well:
+
+<URLs to api/client-go/library-go/apiserver-library-go/operators>
+
+Followup work has been assigned to appropriate teams
+through bugzillas linked in the code. Please treat
+them as the highest priority after landing the bump.
+
+Finally, this means we are blocking ALL PRs to our
+kubernetes fork.
+```
+
+After sending the email block the merge queue, see below.
+
+## Blocking the merge queue
+
+Close to merging a rebase it is good practice to block any merges to openshift/kubernetes
+fork. To do that follow these steps:
+
+1. Open new issues in openshift/kubernetes
+2. Use `Master Branch Frozen For Kubernetes Merging | branch:master` as issue title
+3. Add `tide/merge-blocker` label to issues (you might need group lead for this)
+4. All PR's  (including the rebase) are now forbidden to merge to master branch
+5. Before landing the rebase PR, close this issue
+
+## Send email announcing work done
+
+Last email should be send after merging the bump as a
+reply to previous:
+
+```
+<URL to your o/k PR> just merged.
+It'll take some time to get newer kublet, but in the meantime we'll
+continue to monitor CI. I encourage everyone to hold off from
+merging any major changes to our kubernetes fork to provide clear CI
+signal for the next 2-3 days.
+
+The following bugs were opened during the process, please treat
+them as the highest priority and release blockers for your team:
+
+<list bugs and assigned team>
+```
+
+## Followup work
+
+1. Update cluster-kube-apiserver-operator `pre-release-lifecycle` alert's
+`removed_release` version similarly to https://github.com/openshift/cluster-kube-apiserver-operator/pull/1382.
+
+## Updating with `git merge`
+
+*This is the preferred way to update to patch releases of kubernetes*
+
+After the initial bump as described above it is possible to update
+to newer released version using `git merge`. To do that follow these steps:
+
+
+1. Fetch latest upstream changes:
+```
+git fetch upstream
+```
+   where `upstream` points at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/, and check
+   the incoming changes:
+```
+git log v1.25.0..v1.25.2 --ancestry-path --reverse --no-merges
+```
+2. (optional) Revert any commits that were merged into kubernetes between previous
+   update and current one.
+
+3. Fetch latest state of openshift fork, checkout the appropriate branch and
+   create a new branch for the bump
+```
+git fetch openshift
+git checkout openshift/release-4.12
+git checkout -b bump-1.25.2
+```
+   where `openshift` points at https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/.
+
+4. Merge the changes from appropriate [released version](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/#detailed-release-history-for-active-branches):
+```
+git merge v1.25.2
+```
+   Most likely you'll encounter conflicts, but most are around go.sum and go.mod
+   files, coming from newer versions, but at this point in time leave the conflicts
+   as they are and continue the merge.
+```
+git add --all
+git merge --continue
+```
+   This should create a commit titled `Merge tag 'v1.25.2' into bump-1.25.2`.
+
+5. Now return to the list of conflicts from previous step and fix all the files
+   picking appropriate changes, in most cases picking the newer version.
+   When done, commit all of them as another commit:
+```
+git add --all
+git commit -m "UPSTREAM: <drop>: manually resolve conflicts"
+```
+   This ensures the person reviewing the bump can easily review all the conflicts
+   and their resolution.
+
+6. (optional) Update openshift dependencies and run `go mod tidy` to have the
+   branch names resolved to proper go mod version. Remember to use the released
+   versions matching the branch you're modifying.
+   This is usually required ONLY if you know there has been changes in one of
+   the libraries that need to be applied to our fork, which happens rarely.
+   Also usually, this is done by the team introducing the changes in the libraries.
+
+7. Run `/bin/bash` in a container using the command and image described in [Updating generated files](#updating-generated-files)
+   section:
+```
+podman run -it --rm -v $( pwd ):/go/k8s.io/kubernetes:Z --workdir=/go/k8s.io/kubernetes registry.ci.openshift.org/openshift/release:rhel-8-release-golang-1.19-openshift-4.12 /bin/bash
+```
+   In the container run `hack/update-vendor.sh` and `make update OS_RUN_WITHOUT_DOCKER=yes FORCE_HOST_GO=1`.
+
+NOTE: Make sure to use the correct version of the image (both openshift and golang
+versions must be appropriate), as a reference check `openshift-hack/images/hyperkube/Dockerfile.rhel`
+file.
+
+NOTE: You might encounter problems when running the above, make sure to check [Potential problems](#potential-problems)
+section below.
+
+
+8. Update kubernetes version in `openshift-hack/images/hyperkube/Dockerfile.rhel`
+   and commit all of that as:
+```
+git commit -m "UPSTREAM: <drop>: hack/update-vendor.sh, make update and update image"
+```
+
+9. Congratulations, you can open a PR with updated k8s patch version!
+
+### Potential problems
+
+While running `make update` in step 7 above, you might encounter one of the following problems:
+
+```
+go: inconsistent vendoring in /go/k8s.io/kubernetes/_output/local/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/k8s.io/code-generator:
+```
+To solve it, edit `staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator/go.mod` removing this line: `k8s.io/code-generator => ../code-generator`.
+Try re-running `make update`, if the problem re-appears change directory to `staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator`
+and run `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor`.
+
+NOTE: Make sure to bring back this line: `k8s.io/code-generator => ../code-generator` in `staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator/go.mod`
+after you've run `make update`, otherwise `verify` step will fail during submission.
+
+```
+etcd version 3.5.6 or greater required
+```
+Grab newer version of etcd from https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/ and place
+it in `/usr/local/bin/etcd`.
+
+## Updating with `rebase.sh` (experimental)
+
+The above steps are available as a script that will merge and rebase along the happy path without automatic conflict
+resolution and at the end will create a PR for you.
+
+Here are the steps:
+1. Create a new BugZilla with the respective OpenShift version to rebase (Target Release stays ---),
+   Prio&Severity to High with a proper description of the change logs.
+   See [BZ2021468](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021468) as an example.
+2. It's best to start off with a fresh fork of [openshift/kubernetes](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/). Stay on the master branch.
+3. This script requires `jq`, `git`, `podman` and `bash`, `gh` is optional.
+4. In the root dir of that fork run:
+```
+openshift-hack/rebase.sh --k8s-tag=v1.25.2 --openshift-release=release-4.12 --bugzilla-id=2003027
+```
+
+where `k8s-tag` is the [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/) release tag, the `openshift-release`
+is the OpenShift release branch in [openshift/kubernetes](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/) and the `bugzilla-id` is the
+BugZilla ID created in step (1).
+
+5. In case of conflicts, it will ask you to step into another shell to resolve those. The script will continue by committing the resolution with `UPSTREAM: <drop>`.
+6. At the end, there will be a "rebase-$VERSION" branch pushed to your fork.
+7. If you have `gh` installed and are logged in, it will attempt to create a PR for you by opening a web browser.

+
+This file was generated by:
+
+  Commit $( git rev-parse HEAD || "<commit>" )
+  Tag    $( git describe || "<tag>" )
+
+To recreate these results
+
+1. Install an [OpenShift cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/)
+2. Retrieve a \`.kubeconfig\` file with administrator credentials on that cluster and set the environment variable KUBECONFIG
+
+    export KUBECONFIG=PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG
+
+3. Clone the OpenShift source repository and change to that directory:
+
+    git clone https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes.git
+    cd kubernetes
+
+4. Place the \`oc\` binary for that cluster in your PATH
+5. Run the conformance test:
+
+    openshift-hack/conformance-k8s.sh
+
+Nightly conformance tests are run against release branches and reported https://openshift-gce-devel.appspot.com/builds/origin-ci-test/logs/periodic-ci-origin-conformance-k8s/
